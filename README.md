# Readme

The purpose of this repository is to store transformed data that will be used for insight generation. We saved the details of the process in 'data_transformation.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook.

## Data 
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) provides a wide range of statistical data on Australia's economic, population, environmental, and social issues.  Data tables called "Population and People, ASGS and LGA, 2011, 2014-2019” and “Health and Disability, ASGS and LGA, 2011, 2014-2018” are from “1410.0 - Data by Region, 2014-19” collection from the ABS. The two data tables contain information about the population, health, and disability in Australia between 2014 to 2019 with various Australian Statistical Geography Standards (ASGS) such as Australia, State and Territory, Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA), SA2, SA3, SA4, and Local Government Area (LGA). 

We transformed this ABS data to an easy-to-process format and saved it to a new CSV file called “transformed_data.csv” in this repository.
