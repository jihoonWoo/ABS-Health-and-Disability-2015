# ABS-Health-and-Disability-2015

The purpose of this repository is to transform for data insight generation. The repository includes source data and Jupyter Notebook as well as the transformed data.

"Population and People, ASGS and LGA, 2011, 2014-2019” data and “Health and Disability, ASGS and LGA, 2011, 2014-2018” data are from “1410.0 - Data by Region, 2014-19” collection from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)(https://www.abs.gov.au/)

The Jupyter Notebook is a written Python program language that reads the ABS data to transform into a required format for data insight generation.
